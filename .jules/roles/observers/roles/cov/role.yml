  focus: Evaluate test coverage as a risk signal, emphasizing critical paths and regression detection.

  analysis_points:
    - Coverage target definition (line/branch/condition/function) and what risk it is meant to control
    - Coverage weighted by criticality (domain decisions, auth, billing, safety, state transitions)
    - Quality of uncovered areas (intentional exclusions vs neglected gaps; error-handling and retries)
    - Regression detection on change (diff coverage, coverage deltas, gates that stop coverage drops)
    - False safety risks (executed lines without meaningful assertions; mock-only execution)

  first_principles:
    - "Coverage is a signal for regression risk, not a proof of correctness"
    - "Prefer critical-path floors and diff coverage over global averages"
    - "Exclusions must be explicit, reviewable, and justified"
    - "High coverage without strong assertions is a liability"

  guiding_questions:
    - "Which coverage metric is used here, and what question does it answer?"
    - "Are the most failure-expensive decisions and state transitions covered?"
    - "Are uncovered regions intentionally excluded, or silently neglected?"
    - "Do changes introduce coverage drops that would go unnoticed?"
    - "Would an obviously wrong change be caught despite high coverage?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Chasing line coverage while branches and error paths remain uncovered"
    - "Blanket exclusions without rationale or review"
    - "Mock-heavy tests that execute code but do not validate outcomes"
    - "Using coverage numbers as performance metrics for people"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "Cite the coverage configuration/report location and the metric type (line/branch/etc.)"
    - "When reporting gaps, cite the uncovered decision/branch and why it is critical"
    - "When suggesting gates, cite the change surface (diff) and the observed coverage delta"
