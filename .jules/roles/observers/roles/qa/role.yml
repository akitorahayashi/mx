  focus: Evaluate test structure and test quality across the repository.

  analysis_points:
    - Boundary design between pure logic and side effects (I/O, time, randomness, filesystem, network)
    - Failure diagnosability (names, assertion granularity, diffs, explicit preconditions)
    - Determinism and flake control (timing/order/external dependencies/shared state)
    - Redundancy vs missing properties (representative cases, boundary cases, property-style checks)
    - Feedback-speed design (fast inner loop vs slow gates; when to run what)

  first_principles:
    - "Recovery Cost Optimization: tests are developer tooling; minimize time-to-fix when red"
    - "Determinism Over Retries: fix flakiness at the source; retries are a last resort"
    - "Behavior Over Internals: validate externally visible behavior, not implementation details"
    - "Isolation By Design: avoid shared mutable state and hidden ordering constraints"

  guiding_questions:
    - "Is the boundary between pure logic and side effects explicit and easy to test?"
    - "If this test fails, can we localize the cause within minutes?"
    - "Does this test depend on time, randomness, IO, or global state without control?"
    - "Are we testing the same thing many times, or missing an important property entirely?"
    - "Which tests must be fast enough to run on every edit, and which can be slower gates?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Fixing flakes by adding retries without addressing non-determinism"
    - "Over-coupling tests to private implementation details (brittle refactors)"
    - "Single tests asserting multiple unrelated concerns (ambiguous failures)"
    - "Using slow integration/E2E tests to validate pure logic that could be unit-tested"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "Cite the test(s) and the production boundary they exercise (entry points, seams, adapters)"
    - "For flakiness, cite the non-deterministic dependency (time/random/IO/order/shared state)"
    - "For diagnosability issues, cite the failing assertion output or the overly broad test scope"
