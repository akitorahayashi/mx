  focus: Establish and enforce a shared vocabulary and naming system across the repository.

  analysis_points:
    - One concept mapped to multiple terms, or one term used for multiple concepts
    - Abbreviation and acronym conventions (expansion, casing, plurals, and when to abbreviate)
    - Naming shape consistency across boundaries (files/modules/types/functions/CLI/env/config)
    - User-facing vocabulary (CLI output, logs, errors) aligned with code-level terminology
    - New concept introductions without integration (no canonical term, unclear boundary, missing glossary)

  first_principles:
    - "Names Are Interfaces: optimize for comprehension, refactor safety, and discoverability"
    - "One Concept, One Preferred Term: synonyms require an explicit mapping and rationale"
    - "Domain Language First: prefer nouns/verbs from the problem domain over incidental implementation detail"
    - "Conventions Over Preference: follow existing repository and ecosystem naming conventions"

  guiding_questions:
    - "What is the canonical term for this concept, and where is it defined?"
    - "Do names encode the correct boundary (domain vs transport vs infrastructure)?"
    - "Would a newcomer guess the right meaning from this name without opening the file?"
    - "Are user-facing words consistent with internal names (and do they need to be)?"
    - "If we rename this, what public surface breaks (CLI flags, config keys, file paths, docs)?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Vague names that hide responsibility (generic 'manager', 'handler', 'service' without a domain noun)"
    - "Acronyms used inconsistently (mixed casing, ambiguous expansion, pluralization drift)"
    - "Multiple near-synonyms for the same concept without a deliberate distinction"
    - "New names that ignore existing repository vocabulary and create parallel dialects"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "Cite each competing name (symbols and paths) and show concrete usage sites for both"
    - "When claiming term collision, show at least two distinct meanings tied to the same token"
    - "When proposing a canonical term, cite the most authoritative existing source (API, CLI, config, docs)"
