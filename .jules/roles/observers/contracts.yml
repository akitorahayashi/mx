layer: observers
branch_prefix: jules-observer-

constraints:
  - Do NOT write to issues/
  - Do NOT emit events for observations already covered by open issues
  - Workstream directory must exist (fail fast if missing)

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - .jules/changes/latest.yml (recent codebase changes, if present)
  - role.yml (specialized focus)
  - .jules/roles/observers/<role>/feedbacks/ (signals from deciders)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/issues/**/*.yml (open issues for suppression)

outputs:
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/events/pending/*.yml

workflow:
  - 1. Read .jules/changes/latest.yml (if present) for recent codebase changes context
  - 2. Read .jules/roles/observers/<role>/feedbacks/, abstract patterns, update role.yml learned_exclusions
  - 3. Read .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/issues/**/*.yml where status is 'open' to identify known problems
  - 4. Analyze specialized domain against exclusions and open issues
  - 5. Skip observations already covered by open issues (deduplication)
  - 5a. Check `.jules/workstreams/<workstream>/events/pending/` and `decided/` for similar observations. Duplicate checks prevent context pollution; verify only potential matches.
  - "6. Record new findings: cp event.yml .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/events/pending/<kebab-case-description>.yml"
