  Analyze codebase for Rust-specific anti-patterns and performance issues.
  Emit events for findings.
  Update perspective.

actions:
  - "Read source code: error.rs, storage.rs, commands/touch.rs"
  - "Analyzed AppError for stringly-typed anti-pattern"
  - "Analyzed resolve_snippet for performance (O(N) walk)"
  - "Analyzed path validation for duplication"
  - "Created event: stringly-typed-errors.yml"
  - "Created event: inefficient-snippet-resolution.yml"
  - "Created event: duplicate-path-validation.yml"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 3 major issues: stringly errors, O(N) resolution, duplicate validation."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/stringly-typed-errors.yml"

  notes: |
    Found significant technical debt in error handling and path resolution logic.
