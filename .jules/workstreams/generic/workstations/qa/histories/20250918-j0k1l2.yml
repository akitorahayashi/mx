plan: |
  Analyze codebase for test quality issues, focusing on redundancy, global state dependency, and missing coverage.
  Create events for findings and update workstation state.

actions:
  - "Analyzed src/commands/touch.rs and tests/commands/touch.rs"
  - "Analyzed src/lib.rs and src/storage.rs for env dependencies"
  - "Verified test execution with cargo test"
  - "Created 3 event files"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified redundant touch tests and hardcoded env dependencies."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/test-redundancy-touch.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/hardcoded-env-dependencies.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/missing-unit-tests-lib.yml"
  notes: |
    The codebase has strong isolation in test context helpers but core libraries rely on process-global state,
    preventing effective unit testing. Touch command is over-tested.
