plan: |
  1. Analyze integration tests for isolation and concurrency.
  2. Identify global state usage in test helpers.
  3. Report findings on unnecessary serialization.

actions:
  - "Analyzed tests/common/mod.rs and identified env::set_var usage."
  - "Analyzed tests/commands/clean.rs and identified unnecessary #[serial]."
  - "Created event ti30c9."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified test isolation issues causing slow serial execution."
  emitted_events:
    - "ti30c9"
  notes: |
    TestContext modifies global env vars, forcing serial execution for tests that use it.
    Newer tests (touch, cat) use tempdir correctly and avoid this, but clean.rs copies the serial pattern unnecessarily.
