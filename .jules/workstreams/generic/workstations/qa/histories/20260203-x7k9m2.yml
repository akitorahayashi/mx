  1. Explore codebase and tests.
  2. Identify test isolation and redundancy issues.
  3. Emit events for CWD modification and redundant tests.
  4. Update workstation state.

actions:
  - "Analyzed tests/common/mod.rs for isolation issues."
  - "Analyzed src/commands/touch.rs and tests/commands/touch.rs for redundancy and CWD modification."
  - "Created event global-cwd-modification-in-unit-tests.yml."
  - "Created event redundant-touch-tests.yml."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified critical global state leaks in unit tests and redundant testing patterns."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/global-cwd-modification-in-unit-tests.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/redundant-touch-tests.yml"
  notes: |
    Found that src/commands/touch.rs modifies process-global CWD, forcing serial execution.
    Found significant overlap between touch unit and integration tests.
