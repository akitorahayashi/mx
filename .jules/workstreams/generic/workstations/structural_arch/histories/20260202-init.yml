plan: |
  1. Analyze codebase for structural issues (dependency direction, cohesion, naming).
  2. Create event files for identified issues.
  3. Initialize workstation state (perspective and history).

actions:
  - "Analyzed src/commands/ structure and dependencies."
  - "Identified lateral dependency between copy_snippet and touch."
  - "Identified misplaced shared logic in touch.rs."
  - "Identified inconsistent naming in command modules."
  - "Created 3 pending event files."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 3 structural issues: lateral dependency, misplaced shared logic, and inconsistent naming."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/lateral-dependency-copy-touch.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/misplaced-shared-logic.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/inconsistent-naming.yml"
  notes: |
    Initial run for structural_arch role. Found clear violations of boundary and cohesion principles.
