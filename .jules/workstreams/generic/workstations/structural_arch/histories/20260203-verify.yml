  1. Analyze codebase for structural violations (dependencies, cohesion, naming).
  2. Verify if identified issues are covered by open issues in `.jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/issues/`.
  3. Emit events for new findings only.

actions:
  - "Analyzed src/commands/copy_snippet.rs and found lateral dependency on touch.rs."
  - "Analyzed src/commands/touch.rs and found misplaced shared logic."
  - "Analyzed src/main.rs and found naming inconsistencies."
  - "Analyzed .github/workflows/ and found environment drift."
  - "Checked open issues and confirmed coverage: decouple-context-logic.yml, standardize-naming.yml, cicd-standardization.yml, cleanup-models.yml."

outcomes:
  summary: "Verified structural integrity. Confirmed coupling, naming, drift, and redundancy issues are covered by existing open issues."
