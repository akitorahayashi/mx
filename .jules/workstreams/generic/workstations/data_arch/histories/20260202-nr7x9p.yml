plan: |
  Analyze data models and flow efficiency. Focus on redundant definitions and coupling issues exposed by recent changes (touch, cat, storage migration).

actions:
  - "Analyzed src/storage.rs for data models."
  - "Analyzed src/commands/ for command implementations and dependencies."
  - "Identified coupling of context logic in touch.rs."
  - "Identified redundant snippet models."
  - "Identified dead fields in ListEntry."
  - "Created 3 event files."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 3 data architecture issues: coupling in touch command, redundant snippet models, and dead code."

    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/dead-list-entry-fields.yml"
  notes: |
    The `touch` command has effectively become a library for context file operations, which is an anti-pattern.
    Snippet data models are duplicated across storage and command layers without value.
    Cleanup of deprecated metadata fields was incomplete in `ListEntry`.
