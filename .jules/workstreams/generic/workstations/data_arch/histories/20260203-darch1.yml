plan: |
  Analyze codebase for data architecture issues, specifically focusing on data model redundancy, coupling, and inefficient transformations.

actions:
  - "Read codebase files (src/lib.rs, src/storage.rs, src/commands/*, src/error.rs)."
  - "Identified redundant SnippetFile and CopyOutcome."
  - "Identified dead fields in ListEntry."
  - "Identified implicit storage configuration."
  - "Identified coupling between command modules."
  - "Identified lossy error types."
  - "Created 5 pending event files."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 5 data architecture issues."

  notes: |
    Initial analysis of the codebase reveals several violations of data architecture principles, particularly around SSOT and modularity.
