inputs:

plan: |
  1. Explore codebase to identify data architecture issues, focusing on new commands (cat, touch).
  2. Analyze path resolution logic in `touch.rs` and its usage in `cat`, `clean`.
  3. Verify extension handling for dotfiles.
  4. Create event for identified flaw.

actions:
  - "Read src/commands/touch.rs to analyze resolve_path logic."
  - "Read src/commands/cat.rs and clean.rs to confirm dependency on touch.rs."
  - "Verified dotfile extension behavior with a reproduction script."
  - "Created event implicit-file-extension-logic-flaw.yml."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified a flaw in `mx touch` where dotfiles without extensions are incorrectly appended with `.md`."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/implicit-file-extension-logic-flaw.yml"
  notes: |
    The logic `if path.extension().is_none()` returns true for files like `.gitignore`, leading to `.gitignore.md`.
    This contradicts the README claim that extensions are preserved (only true for files with standard extensions like .yaml).
