plan: |
  Analyze CI/CD workflows for reproducibility, security, and efficiency issues.
  Focus on .github/workflows and rust-toolchain.toml.

actions:
  - "Read .jules/changes/latest.yml"
  - "Read .jules/workstreams/generic/workstations/devops/perspective.yml (created new)"
  - "Analyzed .github/workflows/ and rust-toolchain.toml"
  - "Created event: Unpinned Third-Party Actions"
  - "Created event: Environment Drift (Stable vs 1.90.0)"
  - "Created event: Redundant Build Logic in Release Workflow"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified unpinned actions, toolchain drift between CI/Release, and duplicated build logic."

  notes: |
    The environment drift is critical as it undermines the confidence in the release artifact.
    Unpinned actions are a widespread issue in the workflows.
