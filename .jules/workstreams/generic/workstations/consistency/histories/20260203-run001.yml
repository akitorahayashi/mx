plan: |
  1. Initialize missing perspective.yml.
  2. Analyze codebase for documentation drift.
  3. Create events for found inconsistencies.
  4. Update workstation state.

actions:
  - "Initialized perspective.yml"
  - "Analyzed README.md vs src/ implementation"
  - "Created event ev1clp for MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD asymmetry"
  - "Created event ev2prj for Project Root detection logic"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 2 inconsistencies regarding clipboard config and project root detection."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/clipboard-asymmetry.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/project-root-detection.yml"
  notes: |
    Found that MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD implementation is symmetric (broken for most tools) contrary to docs implication.
    Found that project root detection is effectively non-existent (always CWD), contradicting docs about "outside project" behavior.
