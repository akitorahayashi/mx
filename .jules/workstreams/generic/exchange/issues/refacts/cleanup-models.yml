title: "Cleanup Dead Code and Redundant Models"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Remove dead fields in ListEntry and unify duplicate snippet models to reduce technical debt."
problem: |
  The codebase contains dead fields (`title`, `description`) in `ListEntry` that are relics of deprecated metadata support. Additionally, `SnippetFile` (storage) and `CopyOutcome` (command) are structurally identical, causing unnecessary duplication and mapping code. There is also unnecessary cloning in `join_paths`.
impact: |
  Dead code creates confusion for developers about what data is actually used. Redundant models increase maintenance burden as changes must be synchronized across multiple structs. Unnecessary cloning impacts performance.
desired_outcome: |
  `ListEntry` is cleaned of dead fields. `CopyOutcome` is removed or refactored to reuse `SnippetFile` (or a shared DTO). `join_paths` avoids unnecessary cloning.
