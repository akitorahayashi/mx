title: "Standardize Command Naming and Domain Terminology"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Rename files and concepts to be consistent (e.g., 'Snippet' everywhere, rename implementation files to match commands)."
problem: |
  The project suffers from pervasive naming inconsistencies:
  1. File names do not match commands (`mx list` -> `list_snippets.rs`, `mx command` -> `copy_snippet.rs`).
  2. Terminology mix: "Snippet" vs "Command" for the same concept.
  3. "Project Root" is used to describe what is actually just the current working directory.
  4. `mx touch` implies file creation but defaults to pasting clipboard content, which is unexpected behavior.
impact: |
  Inconsistent naming increases cognitive load for contributors. Misleading terms (Project Root, Touch) confuse users about the tool's behavior and capability.
desired_outcome: |
  1. Command implementation files are renamed to match the CLI command (e.g., `list.rs`, `copy.rs`).
  2. "Snippet" is used consistently as the internal domain term.
  3. `find_project_root` is renamed to reflect it finds CWD (or logic is updated to actually find a root).
  4. `mx touch` behavior is clarified or flags are adjusted (e.g., require explicit flag for paste or rename command). *Note: Renaming the command might be a breaking change, so changing default behavior or improving docs/flags is preferred.*
constraints: []
risks:
  - "Renaming files will require updating all module declarations."
  - "Changing CLI behavior is a breaking change."
