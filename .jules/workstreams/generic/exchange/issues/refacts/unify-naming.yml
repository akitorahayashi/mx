title: "Unify Naming Conventions"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Standardize naming for file identifiers, CLI arguments, and modules to reduce cognitive load."

# Content
problem: |
  The codebase uses inconsistent terminology:
  1. "Key" refers to both global snippets and local context files.
  2. File identifiers are variously named `key`, `snippet`, and `query`.
  3. Modules use mixed plurality (`copy_snippet` vs `list_snippets`) and verbs/nouns inconsistently.
  4. The CLI verb `command` (alias `c`) is ambiguous for copying snippets.

impact: |
  Inconsistent naming increases cognitive load for contributors and users. It makes the code harder to read and the CLI harder to learn.

desired_outcome: |
  Consistent naming conventions:
  1. Distinct terms for global snippets vs local context aliases.
  2. Unified argument names (e.g. always `snippet` or always `key` where appropriate).
  3. Consistent module naming (e.g. `src/commands/copy.rs`, `src/commands/list.rs`).
  4. CLI verbs that match their action (e.g. `mx copy` instead of `mx command`).

constraints:
  - Changing CLI verbs is a breaking change. Consider keeping `command` as an alias if necessary, or fully breaking it if acceptable for the project stage.

risks:
  - Breaking changes for users relying on `mx command`.
