title: "Fix Clipboard Configuration for Asymmetric Commands"
label: "bugs"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Allow MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD to support distinct copy and paste commands."

# Content
problem: |
  The current implementation of `MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD` assumes that the same command is used for both copy (writing to stdin) and paste (reading from stdout). This is incompatible with standard tools like `xclip` / `wl-copy` which use different commands or flags for copy vs paste.

impact: |
  Users cannot use standard clipboard managers with `mx` via configuration, limiting usability on Linux or custom environments.

desired_outcome: |
  `MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD` should support specifying separate commands for copy and paste, or the configuration format should be changed to allow a pair of commands.

constraints:
  - Backward compatibility for `MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD` if possible, or a clear migration path.

risks: []
