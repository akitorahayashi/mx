title: "Sync Documentation with Implementation"
label: "docs"
priority: "low"
summary: "Update README and help text to include missing aliases and remove legacy feature references."
problem: |
  Documentation is out of sync with reality:
  1. `README.md` is missing aliases `atk`, `rf`, `pl` which are implemented in `touch.rs`.
  2. CLI help text mentions "slash command generation", a legacy feature that has been removed.
impact: |
  Users miss out on useful shortcuts (aliases). Users are confused by references to non-existent features.
desired_outcome: |
  1. `README.md` lists all supported aliases.
  2. CLI help text accurately reflects current functionality.
