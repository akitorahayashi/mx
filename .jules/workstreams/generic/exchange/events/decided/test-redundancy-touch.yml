# Content
title: "Redundant testing of touch command logic"
statement: |
  The core logic for the `mx touch` command (path resolution, file creation, overwriting) is tested twice:
  once in unit tests (`src/commands/touch.rs`) and again in integration tests (`tests/commands/touch.rs`).
  This increases test suite maintenance cost and execution time without adding significant coverage value.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "tests module"
    note: "Unit tests cover path resolution, creation, idempotency, and force overwrite."
  - path: "tests/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "touch_creates_context_files"
      - "touch_force_overwrites"
    note: "Integration tests cover the exact same scenarios using the CLI."
