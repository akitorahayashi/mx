# Content
title: "Deprecated Metadata Fields in ListEntry"
statement: |
  The ListEntry struct retains title and description fields that are permanently set to None, creating a misleading data contract. This dead code implies functionality that has been removed and complicates the data model unnecessarily.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/list_snippets.rs"
    loc:
      - "ListEntry struct definition"
    note: "Contains Option<String> fields for title and description."
  - path: "src/commands/list_snippets.rs"
    loc:
      - "list function"
    note: "Hardcodes title and description to None during mapping."
