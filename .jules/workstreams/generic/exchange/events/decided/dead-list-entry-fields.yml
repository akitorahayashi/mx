title: "Dead fields in ListEntry struct"
statement: |
  `ListEntry` struct contains `title` and `description` fields which are always `None` as metadata support has been deprecated/removed. This results in misleading data models and unnecessary Optional wrapping.

evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/list_snippets.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct ListEntry"
      - "fn list"
    note: "Fields are defined but always populated with None."
