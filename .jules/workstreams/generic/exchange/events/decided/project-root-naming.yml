title: "Project Root Semantic Mismatch"
statement: |
  The term "Project Root" and documentation imply semantic detection (e.g., git root), but the implementation relies solely on the Current Working Directory.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "std::env::current_dir().map_err(AppError::Io)"
    note: "find_project_root() simply returns current_dir()."
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "runs outside of a project (project root cannot be detected)"
    note: "Implies a failure mode or detection logic that does not exist."
