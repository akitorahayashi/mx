title: "Unverified Binary Download in CI"
statement: |
  The `install-jlo` action downloads the `jlo` binary from a GitHub Release URL using `curl` without verifying a cryptographic checksum (SHA256). This exposes the pipeline to supply-chain attacks if the release asset is compromised or the URL is hijacked.
