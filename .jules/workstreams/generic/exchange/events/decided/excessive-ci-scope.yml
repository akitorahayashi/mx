title: "Excessive CI Scope: Building Release Artifacts in PRs"
statement: |
  The `ci-workflows.yml` invokes `build.yml` which unconditionally runs the `build-release` job for all four target platforms (Linux/macOS x x86/ARM). This expensive operation runs on every Pull Request, significantly slowing down the developer feedback loop and wasting CI resources, when `cargo test` (running debug builds) would suffice for verification.
