# Content
title: "Lateral dependency between commands (`copy` -> `touch`)"
statement: |
  `src/commands/copy_snippet.rs` imports utility functions directly from `src/commands/touch.rs`, violating command independence and creating brittle coupling. This lateral dependency means changes to `touch` command implementation details could break `copy` command logic.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::commands::touch::{find_project_root, validate_path};"
    note: "Direct import of `touch` module internals."
  - path: "src/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn find_project_root() -> Result<PathBuf, AppError>"
    note: "Generic utility hosted in specific command module."
