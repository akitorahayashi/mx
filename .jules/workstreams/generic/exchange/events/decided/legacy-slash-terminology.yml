# Content
title: "Legacy 'Slash Command' Terminology in CLI Help"
statement: |
  The CLI help text description refers to "slash command generation", a legacy feature that has been removed from the codebase. This outdated terminology misleads users about the tool's current capabilities.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "#[command(about = \"Unified CLI for mx snippets and slash command generation\")]"
    note: "Explicit reference to 'slash command generation'."
