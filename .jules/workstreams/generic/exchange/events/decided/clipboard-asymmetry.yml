title: "MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD implementation incompatible with asymmetric clipboard tools"
statement: |
  The documentation suggests MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD can be used to provide a custom clipboard command, but the implementation assumes the same command string is used for both copy (stdin) and paste (stdout). This makes it incompatible with standard asymmetric tools like xclip/wl-copy, rendering the feature unusable for its primary use case.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "MX_CLIPBOARD_CMD"
    note: "Documentation implies support for custom clipboard commands without noting symmetry constraint."
  - path: "src/commands/clipboard.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct ClipboardCommand"
      - "impl SystemClipboard"
    note: "Implementation reuses the same command and arguments for both copy and paste operations."
