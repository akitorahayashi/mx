title: "Environment Drift: CI uses Stable, Release uses 1.90.0"
statement: |
  The CI workflows (Build, Test, Lint) default to the 'stable' Rust toolchain via the setup action, while the Release workflow explicitly pins '1.90.0'. This creates a risk where code passes CI but fails Release (or vice versa) due to compiler differences.
