title: "Over-permissioned Build Job in Release Workflow"
statement: |
  The `.github/workflows/release.yml` grants `contents: write` permission to the entire workflow. This permission is inherited by the `build` job, which executes `cargo build` and potentially untrusted build scripts/dependencies. If a dependency is compromised, it could abuse this permission to modify the repository or release assets. The `build` job should operate with `contents: read` (or less), and only the `release` job needs `contents: write`.
