# Content
title: "Undocumented aliases and legacy CLI description"
statement: |
  The `mx touch` command implements aliases (`atk`, `rf`, `pl`) that are not documented in the README. Additionally, the CLI help text references "slash command generation", a legacy feature that has been removed.

# Evidence supporting the observation
