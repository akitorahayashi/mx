title: "Redundant SnippetFile and CopyOutcome definitions"
statement: |
  `SnippetFile` (internal storage representation) and `CopyOutcome` (command DTO) are structurally identical. The transformation in `CopySnippet::execute` is a direct field-for-field copy, creating unnecessary code duplication and maintenance burden.

evidence:
  - path: "src/storage.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct SnippetFile"
    note: "Internal storage representation."
  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct CopyOutcome"
      - "fn execute"
    note: "Identical command output struct and 1:1 mapping."
