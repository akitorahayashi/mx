# Content
title: "High coverage observed for recent mx touch and cat features"
statement: |
  Recent changes introducing `mx cat` and `mx touch` are well-covered by both unit and integration tests. The storage migration to `.mx/` is implicitly covered by verifying file operations in the new directory. Security risks (path traversal) and edge cases (force overwrite) are explicitly tested.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "whole file"
    note: "Comprehensive integration tests for mx touch covering aliases, security, and force overwrite."

  - path: "tests/commands/cat.rs"
    loc:
      - "whole file"
    note: "Integration tests for mx cat covering display logic and error handling."

  - path: "src/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "Inline unit tests for resolve_path and validate_path logic."

  - path: "tests/commands/list.rs"
    loc:
      - "whole file"
    note: "Verifies SnippetStorage enumeration logic."
