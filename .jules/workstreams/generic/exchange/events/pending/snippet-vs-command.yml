# Content
title: "Inconsistent Terminology for Snippets/Commands"
statement: |
  The concept of a reusable text fragment is referred to as "Snippet" in internal types, list output, and some documentation, but as "Command" in the CLI subcommand, storage directory structure, and aliases.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "Command { snippet: String }"
    note: "CLI subcommand is named 'Command', but takes a 'snippet' argument."
  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub(crate) struct CopySnippet"
    note: "Internal logic uses 'Snippet' naming."
  - path: "src/storage.rs"
    loc:
      - "root.join(\"commands\")"
    note: "Storage directory is hardcoded to 'commands'."
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "list_snippets()?"
    note: "List operation refers to 'snippets'."
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "mx command <snippet>"
    note: "User documentation mixes both terms in the same instruction."
