# Content
title: "Inconsistent CLI Verb for Copying Snippets"
statement: |
  The CLI subcommand `command` (alias `c`) is used to copy snippets, but the internal logic is `copy_snippet` and the domain is "snippet copying". "Command" is ambiguous and generic.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "Commands::Command"
      - "handle_command"
    note: "CLI defines `Command` enum variant and `handle_command` function."
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "copy_snippet"
    note: "Library exposes `copy_snippet` function."
  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "CopySnippet"
    note: "Internal implementation is named `CopySnippet`."
