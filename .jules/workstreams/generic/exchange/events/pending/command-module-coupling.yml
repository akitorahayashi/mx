# Content
title: "High Coupling Between Command Modules"
statement: |
  The copy_snippet and cat command modules directly import logic (resolve_path, validate_path) from the touch module. This violates command isolation, making the touch module a de-facto shared library for path logic and creating a hidden dependency graph that complicates refactoring.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::commands::touch::validate_path"
    note: "Direct dependency on touch module logic."
  - path: "src/commands/cat.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::commands::touch::{resolve_path, validate_path}"
    note: "Direct dependency on touch module logic."
