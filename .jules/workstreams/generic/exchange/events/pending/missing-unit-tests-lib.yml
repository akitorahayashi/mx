# Content
title: "Missing unit tests for library glue code"
statement: |
  The public library functions in `src/lib.rs` (e.g., `touch_context`, `copy_snippet`, `list_snippets`) lack
  unit tests. While they are covered by integration tests, unit tests are needed to verify edge cases and
  ensure logic correctness in isolation, but are currently prevented by tight coupling to environment state.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "touch_context"
      - "copy_snippet"
      - "list_snippets"
    note: "Public API entry points with business logic but no direct unit tests."
