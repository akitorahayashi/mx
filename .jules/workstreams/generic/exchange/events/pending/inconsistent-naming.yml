# Content
title: "Inconsistent command module and function naming"
statement: |
  Command implementation modules and exported functions lack a consistent naming convention. Some map directly to the CLI command (e.g., `cat` -> `cat.rs`, `touch` -> `touch.rs`), while others diverge (e.g., `list` -> `list_snippets.rs`, `command/copy` -> `copy_snippet.rs`). This inconsistency increases cognitive load when navigating from CLI usage to code implementation.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub(crate) mod copy_snippet;"
    note: "Maps to `mx command` (alias `c`). Expected `command.rs` or `copy.rs`."
  - path: "src/commands/list_snippets.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub(crate) mod list_snippets;"
    note: "Maps to `mx list` (alias `ls`). Expected `list.rs`."
  - path: "src/commands/cat.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub(crate) mod cat;"
    note: "Consistent mapping."
  - path: "src/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub(crate) mod touch;"
    note: "Consistent mapping."
