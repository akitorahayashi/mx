# Content
title: "Unverified Binary Download in Install Action"
statement: |
  The `.github/actions/install-jlo` composite action downloads the `jlo` binary from GitHub Releases
  using `curl` without verifying its checksum (SHA256). This exposes the pipeline to supply-chain attacks
  if the release asset is compromised or the download URL is spoofed.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/actions/install-jlo/action.yml"
    loc:
      - "83-89"
    note: "Downloads binary via curl without checksum verification."
