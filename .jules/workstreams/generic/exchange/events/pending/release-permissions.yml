# Content
title: "Excessive Permissions in Release Workflow"
statement: |
  The `release.yml` workflow grants `contents: write` permission at the workflow level.
  This permission propagates to all jobs, including the `build` job which compiles code
  and runs potentially untrusted build scripts (via `build.rs` or proc-macros).
  The write permission should be scoped strictly to the `release` job.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "11"
    note: "Top-level permissions granting write access to all jobs."
