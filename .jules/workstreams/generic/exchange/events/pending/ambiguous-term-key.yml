# Content
title: "Ambiguous Term 'Key'"
statement: |
  The term "Key" is used for both "snippet name/path" (in `storage.rs` and `list_snippets.rs`) and "context file alias/path" (in `touch.rs`, `cat.rs`). These are distinct domains (global snippets vs local context) but share the same generic name.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/storage.rs"
    loc:
      - "SnippetFile.key"
    note: "Refers to a global snippet identifier."
  - path: "src/commands/touch.rs"
    loc:
      - "touch(..., key: &str, ...)"
    note: "Refers to a local context file alias or path."
