# Content
title: "Inconsistent Argument Naming for File Identifiers"
statement: |
  The concept of a file identifier is named `key` in `touch`, `cat`, `clean`, and `list` return types, but `snippet` in `main.rs` for the copy command, and `query` in `lib.rs` and `copy_snippet.rs`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "Commands::Touch { key, .. }"
      - "Commands::Command { snippet }"
    note: "CLI arguments use different names for the same identifier concept."
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "touch_context(key: &str, ...)"
      - "copy_snippet(query: &str, ...)"
    note: "Library functions use `key` vs `query`."
  - path: "src/storage.rs"
    loc:
      - "resolve_snippet(raw_query: &str)"
      - "SnippetFile.key"
    note: "Storage uses `raw_query` for input but `key` for the struct field."
