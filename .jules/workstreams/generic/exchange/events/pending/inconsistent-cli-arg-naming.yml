# Content
title: "Inconsistent CLI Argument Naming (key vs snippet)"
statement: |
  The CLI consistently uses the term `key` to refer to file identifiers across the `touch`, `cat`, and `clean` subcommands, as well as in internal data structures. However, the `mx command` subcommand breaks this pattern by naming its argument `snippet`, despite referring to the same concept (a file identifier/key).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "Touch { key: String, ... }"
      - "Cat { key: String }"
      - "Clean { key: Option<String> }"
    note: "Consistent usage of 'key'."
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "Command { snippet: String }"
    note: "Divergent usage of 'snippet'."
  - path: "src/storage.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub(crate) struct SnippetFile { pub key: String, ... }"
    note: "Internal model uses 'key'."
