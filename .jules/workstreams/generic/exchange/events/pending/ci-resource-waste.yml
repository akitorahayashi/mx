title: "Excessive CI Resource Usage"
statement: |
  The `ci-workflows.yml` workflow triggers the `build.yml` workflow on every Pull Request.
  `build.yml` executes a matrix of 4 jobs (Linux x86/ARM, macOS x86/ARM). This results in
  heavy resource consumption (4 concurrent builds) for every commit pushed to a PR, slowing
  down feedback and wasting minutes.
