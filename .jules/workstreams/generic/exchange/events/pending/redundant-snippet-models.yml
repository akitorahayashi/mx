# Content
title: "Redundant SnippetFile and CopyOutcome definitions"
statement: |
  SnippetFile and CopyOutcome structs share an identical schema representing a file reference, violating the Single Source of Truth principle. This duplication requires keeping two identical structures in sync without a clear boundary or conversion necessity.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/storage.rs"
    loc:
      - "SnippetFile struct definition"
    note: "Defines key, relative_path, absolute_path."

  - path: "src/commands/copy_snippet.rs"
    loc:
      - "CopyOutcome struct definition"
    note: "Defines identical key, relative_path, absolute_path fields."
