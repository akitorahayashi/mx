# AGENTS.md: Development Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `mix` project, including its architecture, coding standards, and key development tasks.

## Project Name

- **Name**: `mix`

## Project Summary

`mix` is a Rust CLI tool designed to streamline two developer workflows:
1.  Quickly copying predefined code snippets to the clipboard.
2.  Managing context files in project directories with flexible path resolution and automatic directory creation via the `mix touch` command.

It uses a layered architecture (CLI -> Commands -> Core -> Storage) and relies on a local directory (`~/.config/mix/`) to store markdown snippets and a central `config.yml` for metadata.

## Directory Structure

- `./`: Root directory containing `Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, and configuration files.
- `.github/`: CI/CD workflows for building, testing, and linting.
- `src/`: Main source code for the Rust application.
    - `src/core/`: Core logic for snippet management and slash command generation.
- `tests/`: Integration tests for the CLI and its core API.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Rust
- **Core Libraries**:
    - `clap`: For command-line argument parsing.
    - `serde` (`serde_yaml`, `serde_json`): For serialization and deserialization of data.
    - `walkdir`: For directory traversal.
- **Testing Libraries**:
    - `assert_cmd`, `predicates`: For CLI integration testing.
    - `serial_test`: For running tests serially.
    - `tempfile`: For creating temporary files and directories in tests.

## Coding Standards

The project enforces coding standards using:
- **`rustfmt`**: Configured in `rustfmt.toml` to maintain a consistent style, with a `max_width` of 100 characters.
- **`clippy`**: Configured in `clippy.toml` to catch common mistakes and improve code quality. It includes rules for cognitive complexity, argument counts, and type complexity.

## Naming Conventions

- **Structs, Enums, Traits**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Cli`, `Commands`, `SlashArg`).
- **Functions, Methods, Variables**: `snake_case` (e.g., `handle_copy`, `cli`, `relative_path`).
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Modules**: `snake_case` (e.g., `core`, `storage`).

## Key Commands

- **Run Application**:
    - `mix list`: List all available snippets.
    - `mix <snippet>`: Copy a specific snippet to the clipboard.
    - `mix touch <key>` / `mix t <key>`: Create context files in `.mix/` directory.
        - Supports predefined aliases (tk, rq, rv, df, pdt, pdr, wn, er)
        - Supports dynamic paths with auto `.md` extension and directory creation
        - Example: `mix t docs/spec` creates `.mix/docs/spec.md`
- **Linting**:
    - `cargo fmt --check`: Check code formatting.
    - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`: Run the linter and check for warnings.
- **Testing**:
    - `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test --all-targets --all-features`: Run all tests.

## Testing Strategy

The project has a comprehensive testing strategy:
- **Framework**: Uses Rust's built-in testing framework.
- **Location**:
    - Unit tests are located alongside the source code in the `src/` directory.
    - Integration tests are in the `tests/` directory, covering both the CLI and the library's public API.
- **CI**: A GitHub Actions workflow (`run-tests.yml`) automatically runs all tests on macOS for every pull request and push to the main branch.
- **Test Support**: A dedicated `src/core/test_support.rs` module provides utilities for testing, such as in-memory stubs for the clipboard and file system, ensuring tests are isolated and repeatable.
