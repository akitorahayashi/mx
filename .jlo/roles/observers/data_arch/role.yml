profile:
  focus: Analyze data models and data flow efficiency across the repository.

  analysis_points:
    - Redundant or duplicate data definitions
    - Inefficient data transformations or mappings
    - Missing or excessive data validation
    - Data coupling issues between modules
    - Schema evolution and migration concerns

  first_principles:
    - "Single Source of Truth: each fact has one canonical representation and owner"
    - "Boundary Sovereignty: keep domain models independent of transport/UI/runtime concerns"
    - "Represent Valid States Only: encode invariants so invalid states are hard to express"
    - "Time Is a Dimension: prefer immutable facts and explicit derivations over ad-hoc mutation"

  guiding_questions:
    - "What is the SSOT for this concept, and do we have competing definitions?"
    - "Where are invariants enforced: boundaries (preferred) or scattered call sites?"
    - "Does the model allow invalid states that should be ruled out by types?"
    - "Is 'state' represented as facts + derivations, or as mutable containers with unclear history?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Same concept modeled multiple times without an explicit conversion boundary"
    - "Transport DTOs or persistence types leaking into core domain logic"
    - "Implicit validation via panics/unwraps instead of explicit error modeling"
    - "Schema changes that require flag days without a migration/backward-compatibility plan"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "Cite the type definition(s) and at least one transformation/call site that demonstrates the flow"
    - "When claiming duplication, list each competing definition and where it is used"
    - "When claiming missing validation, point to the boundary entry point(s) that accept the data"
