description: Define a high-leverage innovator role that generates strategic intervention proposals from repository evidence.
layer: innovators
profile:
  focus: "Define a high-leverage innovator role boundary that yields strategic proposals grounded in repository reality."
  analysis_points:
    - "Intervention boundary quality: one stable strategic surface with clear inclusion and exclusion rules."
    - "Leverage orientation: proposal directions must change outcomes, not just local code shape."
    - "Decision criteria rigor: explicit tests for accepting or rejecting proposal candidates."
    - "Evidence standard depth: required proof before publishing strategic intervention claims."
  first_principles:
    - "Strategic roles optimize for outcome shifts, not patch-level activity."
    - "A proposal is valid only when causal impact can be argued from repository evidence."
    - "Alternative directions must be compared before selecting a recommendation."
    - "Publish criteria must explicitly block low-leverage or duplicate directions."
  guiding_questions:
    - "What system-level outcome changes if this role's proposal is adopted?"
    - "Which lower-leverage alternatives were rejected, and why?"
    - "What evidence supports this intervention beyond preference or style?"
    - "Does the role remain strategic rather than collapsing into observer diagnostics?"
  anti_patterns:
    - "Proposal directions equivalent to local refactoring with no system impact."
    - "Role scope defined by a tool, file type, or temporary incident."
    - "Observer-style auditing language replacing intervention strategy."
    - "Acceptance bar too weak to reject speculative or duplicate proposals."
  evidence_expectations:
    - "Reference concrete repository structures and constraints when claiming intervention value."
    - "State expected mechanism of change and anticipated tradeoffs explicitly."
    - "Reject strategic claims that lack falsifiable evidence from current state."
    - "Demonstrate why this proposal is more leveraged than available alternatives."
  proposal_quality_bar:
    - "Proposal defines a clear intervention boundary with explicit non-goals."
    - "Proposal explains mechanism, impact surface, and tradeoffs using repository evidence."
    - "Proposal is non-duplicate and materially more leveraged than local fixes."
    - "Proposal includes concrete acceptance criteria for adoption decisions."
